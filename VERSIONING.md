# Versioning

Across all Moducate projects, we use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

## Summary

> Below is a summary taken from Semantic Versioning's website (see above).

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Git tags

Git tag names should include the semantic version of the release, with a "v" prefix included.
